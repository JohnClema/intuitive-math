      <p>
        If we want to think about things geometrically, we need a way to describe
        where things are in space, where things are in relation to each other
        and how big they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do that, we can use a co-ordinate system. <Strong>Linear</Strong>{' '}
        co-ordinate systems have two properties - <Strong>units</Strong> and{' '}
        <Strong>dimensions</Strong>. The dimensions correspond to how many different
        combinations you can make with positions in your space. We will often
        see dimensions referred to by the canonical variables{' '}
        <MathJax.Node inline>{'x'}</MathJax.Node>, <MathJax.Node inline>{'y'}</MathJax.Node>,{' '}
        <MathJax.Node inline>{'z'}</MathJax.Node> and so on.
      </p>
      <Animation
        initial={{ rotation: new Euler(0.5, 0.5, 0) }}
        update={(state) => ({
          rotation: new Euler(state.rotation.x,
                              state.rotation.y + 0.001,
                              state.rotation.z),
        })}
        render={(state) => (
          <Visualization width={320} height={240} rotation={state.rotation}>
            <XAxis />
            <YAxis />
            <ZAxis />
          </Visualization>
        )}
      />
      <p>
        There exist infinitely many points in the other corresponding
        dimensions for a single point on one dimension. For instance, if you
        had a two dimensional space and you held <MathJax.Node inline>{'x'}</MathJax.Node>
        constant at <MathJax.Node inline>{'x = 1'}</MathJax.Node>, there are
        still infinitely many points you could pick on the <MathJax.Node inline>{'y'}</MathJax.Node>{' '}
        dimension. If you had a three dimensional space and held <MathJax.Node inline>{'x'}</MathJax.Node>{' '}
        at <MathJax.Node inline>{'x = 1'}</MathJax.Node>, there are infinitely
        many points that you could choose in the <MathJax.Node inline>{'y'}</MathJax.Node>{' '}
        dimension, and then after that, there are infinitely many points you could
        choose in the <MathJax.Node inline>{'z'}</MathJax.Node> dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the <Strong>first</Strong> dimension you would just have a number
        line made up of every possible point
      </p>
      <BlankableVisualization width={320} height={240}>
        <XAxis />
      </BlankableVisualization>
      <p>
        In <Strong>two</Strong> dimensional space, you have a co-ordinate plane
        made up of every possible line
      </p>
      <BlankableVisualization width={320} height={240}>
        <XAxis />
        <YAxis />
      </BlankableVisualization>
      <p>
        In <Strong>three</Strong> dimensional space, you have a volume
        made up of every possible plane
      </p>
      <BlankableVisualization width={320} height={240} rotation={new Euler(0.5, 0.5, 0)}>
        <XAxis />
        <YAxis />
        <ZAxis />
      </BlankableVisualization>
      <p>
        Dimensions above the fourth are a little tricky to visualize, but the
        pattern continues. If two-dimensional space is a plane consisting of
        consists of every possible line and three-dimensional space is a volume
        consisting of every possible plane, then think about what that means
        for four-dimensional space. Or even five-dimensional space.
      </p>
      <p>The logic will generalize to an n-dimensional space</p>
      <p>
        For the sake of simplicitly, we will assume
        that all co-ordinate systems use the same units, meaning that movement
        of one step along one dimension and that if you rotated a system
        such that the one dimension became another, the steps would correspond.
