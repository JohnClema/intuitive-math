All the visualizations for this project are separate components that
you can re-use throughout the project. Be aware that `Animation` and
`Visualization` are quite tightly coupled via context - there is a lot
of performance optimisation work that went into those two to ensure that
viewing the site doesn't immediately chew up resources.
